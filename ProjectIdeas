Here are some of our project ideas:

1) How grammar/spelling affects quality of LLM response

We will create prompts for the LLM in which we know what the expected outcome is ahead of time. 
We fill feed the LLM modified version of the prompts -- some with heavy grammatical errors, some with major spelling errors, some with both -- and compare the quality and accuracy of the responses.
With those, we can analyze how LLM's react to imperfect queries, and can question the reliability of LLM's. In possibly less wealthy areas, where grammar and well-flowing statements may not be as strong, can LLM's be trusted to give reliable information as they become used more and more?
